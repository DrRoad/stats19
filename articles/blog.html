<a href="#introduction" class="anchor"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>stats19</strong> is a new R package that enables access to and processing of Great Britain’s official road traffic casualty database, <a href="https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data">STATS19</a>. It has been peer reviewed thanks to rOpenSci and is now published in the Journal of Open Source Software (<a href="http://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01181">JOSS</a>) <span class="citation">(Lovelace et al. 2019)</span>. For installation and the code, see its home in rOpenSci: <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/stats19" class="uri">https://github.com/ropensci/stats19</a>. In this post, we’ll provide a bit of context, show how the package works, and provide ideads for future work building on the experience.</p>
<p>We started the package in late 2018 following three main motivations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The release of the 2017 road crash statistics, which showed worsening road safety in some areas, increasing the importance of making the data more accessible.</li>
<li>The realisation that many researchers were writing add-hoc code to clean the data, with a huge amount of duplicated (wasted) effort and potential for mistakes to lead to mistakes in the labelling of the data (more on that below).</li>
<li>An understanding of the concept of ‘modularity’ in software design, following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix philosophy</a> that programs should ‘do one thing and do it well’. This realisation has led to code inside the rOpenSci-hosted package <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr"><code>stplanr</code></a> being split-out into 2 separate packages already: <a href="https://github.com/Robinlovelace/cyclestreets"><code>cyclestreets</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/stats19"><code>stats19</code></a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main authors are based at the <a href="https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/transport">Institute for Transport Studies (ITS)</a> and the <a href="https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/">Leeds Institute for Data Analytics (LIDA)</a>, institutions focussed on transport and data-intensive research. We have prior experience writing code to work with road crash data: Robin wrote code for an academic paper on cycle safety in Yorkshire based on STATS19 data <span class="citation">(Lovelace, Roberts, and Kellar 2016)</span>, and put it in the <a href="https://github.com/Robinlovelace/bikeR">robinlovelace/bikeR</a> repo for posterity/reproducibility. Package contributor, Dr Malcolm Morgan, wrote code processing different STATS19 data for the Cycling Infrastructure Prioritisation Toolkit (<a href="https://www.cyipt.bike">CyIPT</a>) and put it in <a href="https://github.com/cyipt/stats19">cyipt/stats19</a>. The large and complex STATS19 data from the UK’s Department for Transport, which is open access but difficult-to-use, represented a perfect opportunity for us to get stuck into a chunky data processing challenge.</p>
<p>We have a wider motivation: we want the roads to be safer. By making data on the nature of road crashes in the UK more publicly accessible (in a usable format), we hope this package saves lives.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-stats19-anyway" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#what-is-stats19-anyway" class="anchor"></a>What is STATS19 anyway?</h2>
<p>One of the reviewer comments from the <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/266">rOpenSci review process (which has 77 comments - lots of knowledge shared)</a> alluded to the package’s esoteric name:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I confess I wish the package name was more expressive–stats19 sounds like an introductory statistics class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We agree! However, the priority with the package is to remain faithful to the data, and alternative name options, such as stats19data, roadcrashesUK and roadSafetyData were not popular. Furthermore, the term ‘stats19’ is strongly associated with road crash data online. The URL <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STATS19" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STATS19</a> resolves to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reported_Road_Casualties_Great_Britain" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reported_Road_Casualties_Great_Britain</a>, for example (this page is provides and excellent introduction to STATS19).</p>
<p>The name comes from a UK police form called <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/775149/Operational_Metrics_Manual.pdf">STATS19</a> (note the capital letters). Why STATS19 and not, say, STATS18 or STATS20? We’re not sure, but there <em>is</em> an official <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/230596/stats20-2011.pdf">STATS20 product</a>, which explains what STATS19 data is and provides guidelines to officers filling in STATS19 form (it’s a 100+ page document providing lots of detail on each variable collected, so worth checking out if you want detail). An important point is that the dataset omits crashes in which nobody was hurt, as emphasised by another government <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/743853/reported-road-casualties-gb-notes-definitions.pdf">document</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The STATS19 data are therefore not a complete record of all injury accidents and this should be borne in mind when using and analysing the data. However, they remain the most detailed, complete and reliable single source of information on road casualties covering the whole of Great Britain, in particular for monitoring trends over time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Department for Transport (DfT) also names the dataset <a href="https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data">STATS19 on the main web page that links to open access road crash data</a>.</p>
<p>The importance of road safety and informed decision making based on crash data cannot be overstated. Two numbers from a strategy <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/8146/strategicframework.pdf">document</a> by the UK government (2011) are worth mentioning here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The economic welfare costs [of road collisions] are estimated at around £16 billion a year while insurance payouts for motoring claims alone are now over £12 billion a year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even more shocking are the <a href="https://www.who.int/gho/road_safety/mortality/en/">global statistics</a>, as summarised by an open access and reproducible academic <a href="https://github.com/Robinlovelace/stats19-gisruk">paper that uses data from the package to explore car-pedestrian crashes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While so many people die on the roads each year in the UK (1,793 people in 2017, 3 deaths per 100,000) and worldwide (1,250,000 people in 2015, 17 deaths per 100,000) and ‘vision zero’ remains a Swedish dream (Johansson 2009), we urge people researching STATS19 and other road safety datasets to focus on a more urgent question: how to stop this carnage?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#the-road-crash-data-in-stats19" class="anchor"></a>The road crash data in stats19</h2>
<p>There are three main different types of CSV files released by the DfT: <code>accidents</code>, <code>vehicles</code> and <code>casualties</code> tables. There is a schema covering these tables but a good amount of work is needed to understand it, let alone be able to the data contained within the files and convert the integers they contain into meaningful data.</p>
<p>The annual statistics have not been released in a consistent way either, making it hard for people to download, or even find, the relevant files. For example, there are separate files for each of the above tables for certain years (e.g. 2016, 2017) but not for all of 1979 - 2017 or 2018 now. The largest chunk is the 1979 - 2004 data, which is made available in a huge ZIP file (<a href="http://data.dft.gov.uk/road-accidents-safety-data/Stats19-Data1979-2004.zip">link</a>). Unzipped this contains the following 3 files, which occupy almost 2 GB on your hard drive:</p>

<p>With those introductions out of the way, lets see what the package can do and how it can empower people (including target audiences of academics, policy makers and road safety campaigners and R programmers/analysts wanting to test their skills on a large spatio-temporal dataset) to access STATS19 data, back to 1979. First install the package in the usual way:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw"><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/topics/install.packages">install.packages</a></span>(<span class="st">"stats19"</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="co"># the dev version is used for this blog post</span></a>

<p>Attach the package as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw"><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/topics/library">library</a></span>(stats19)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## Data provided under OGL v3.0. Cite the source and link to:
## www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/</code></pre>
<p>The easiest way to get STATS19 data is with <code><a href="../reference/get_stats19.html">get_stats19()</a></code>. This function takes 2 main arguments, <code>year</code> and <code>type</code>. The year can be any year between 1979 and 2017.</p>

<a href="#creating-geographic-crash-data" class="anchor"></a>Creating geographic crash data</h2>
<p>An important feature of STATS19 data is that the “accidents” table contains geographic coordinates. These are provided at ~10m resolution in the UK’s official coordinate reference system (the Ordnance Survey National Grid, EPSG code 27700). <strong>stats19</strong> converts the non-geographic tables created by <code><a href="../reference/format_accidents.html">format_accidents()</a></code> into the geographic data form of the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf"><code>sf</code> package</a> with the function <code><a href="../reference/format_sf.html">format_sf()</a></code> as follows:</p>

<pre><code>## 19 rows removed with no coordinates</code></pre>
<p>An example of an administrative zone dataset of relevance to STATS19 data is the boundaries of police forces in England, which is provided in the packaged dataset <code>police_boundaries</code>.

<p>What just happened?</p>
<p>We found the subset of casualties that took place in West Yorkshire with reference to the <code>accident_index</code> variable in the <code>accidents</code> table. Then we used the <strong>dplyr</strong> function <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html">summarise()</a></code>, to find the number of people who were in a car, cycling, and walking when they were injured. This new casualty dataset is joined onto the <code>crashes_wy</code> dataset. The result is a spatial (<code>sf</code>) data frame of crashes in West Yorkshire, with columns counting how many road users of different types were hurt. The joined data has additional variables:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb27"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb27-1" data-line-number="1">base<span class="op">::</span><span class="kw"><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/topics/sets">setdiff</a></span>(<span class="kw"><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/topics/names">names</a></span>(cj), <span class="kw"><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/topics/names">names</a></span>(crashes_wy))</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] "Total"     "walking"   "cycling"   "passenger"</code></pre>
<p>As a simple spatial plot, we can map all the crashes that have happened in West Yorkshire in 2017, with the colour related to the total number of people hurt in each crash. Placing this plot next to a map of West Yorkshire provides context:</p>
<p>In addition to the <code>Total</code> number of people hurt/killed, <code>cj</code> contains a column for each type of casualty (cyclist, car occupant, etc.), and a number corresponding to the number of each type hurt in each crash. It also contains the <code>geometry</code> column from <code>crashes_sf</code>. In other words, joins allow the casualties and vehicles tables to be geo-referenced. We can then explore the spatial distribution of different casualty types. The following figure, for example, shows the spatial distribution of pedestrians and car passengers hurt in car crashes across West Yorkshire in 2017:</p>
